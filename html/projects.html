              documents and tasks required to complete the project. The progress
              performance will be measured against the planned progress for each
              agreed activity in the baseline schedule. This will be presented
              by cumulatively in the weekly reports. The progress breakdown will

              GEDC is committed to continuous improvement of its processes &

              obtained to gather information such as project performance,
              lessons learnt, archiving requirements etc. Internally within
              GEDC, project close out is carried out in accordance with

              GEDC considers Performance Feedback as extremely important and

              understand CLIENT requirements and perceptions. It also allows
              GEDC to continually strive to exceed these expectations. GEDC has
              a clearly defined process for undertaking Project Performance
              Surveys. This process is documented in EDMS. Customer Feedback
              surveying will be subjected to audit within the project audit
              program. Formal feedback will be obtained from the CLIENT point of
              contact prior to the final close-out of the project. Ongoing
              performance feedback will also be taken to ensure that any
              deficiencies in the systems, procedures and or operations are
              identified and rectified.
